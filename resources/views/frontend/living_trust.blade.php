                <p class="content">
                    Living Trust is a Legal Instrument filled with instructions that define exactly who you have chosen to
                    carry out your wishes in case you legally or medically cannot. It outlines and names individuals who are
                    to distribute and receive your assets. Your assets are distributed as per your instructions to heirs you
                    named in case of your passing without the involvement of probate court. This is the important and
                    crucial reason why it is important for people to create a living trust rather than just a will—It
                    creates privacy and in most cases the courts from being involved. While you are alive, a trust assigns
                    someone you choose to make medical and financial decisions for you when you are sick or incapacitated.
                    Creating A trust helps you when you are alive and the time of your Death.

                    Living Trust dictates who will make financial and medical decisions for you until you are able to. All

                    maker. Living Trust is in place to avoid Probate in case there is an unfortunate circumstance, and you

                    Living trusts that are revocable are referred to as a grantor trust. The grantors of a Revocable living

                    owner /grantor of the Trust. Beneficiaries or assets can be changed at any time the Trust owner is
                    alive. The Trust Owner / Grantor can also revoke the Trust and its entirety at any time he is able to
                    make a cognitive decision. There is no requirement for a new tax ID regarding a Grantors Trust. They are
                    no additional forms required either. Income generated by the Trust, or any accounts placed in the trust
                    are to be reported as earned income.

                    role when you may need someone to make medical and financial decisions if you are sick or incapacitated
