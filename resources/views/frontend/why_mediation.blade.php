                    Mediation between two parties can be at times very effective in coming to a
                    resolution without the high cost of Litigation. We offer this option as another
                    potential solution to resolve disputes and avoid a lengthy and costly court
                    process. It can be a very efficient alternative to resolve a disagreement. We
                    recommend this alternative as an initial option to open up dialogue with the
                    opposing party of the case. This will allow you and our firm to understand the
                    position and potential strategy of the opposing party named in the potential

                    lawsuit.

                    Our firm has many years of experience handling the complexity of legal
                    disputes. We strategically review all aspects of your case prior to opening an
                    initial dialogue with the opposing party. These types of disputes can be very
                    personal, full of emotions and can have psychological effects that can be
                    very traumatizing. We guide you and fight for you to secure a satisfactory
                    resolution and at times can in some cases repair relationships.

                <h3 class="heading mb-4">Why Mediation?</h3>
                <p class="content">
                    A dispute resolution by Mediation can help you strategize a solution that can
                    position you in a manner that will settle a dispute favorably and cost
                    effectively.
                    Our firm will guide you and help you understand the process of mediation as
                    well as negotiate your position with all the facts of your case. We will
                    strategically implement all the facts to strengthen your position for the
                    mediation process.
                    In many cases resolving disputes through mediation can create a solution
                    that is more definitive and compliant than stipulations from the court.
                    If negotiation through mediation do not produce a resolution, then there is
                    still always the option of litigation.
